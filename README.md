# PredictionModel_NBA
Prediction Model in NBA. I made this project in 10 days with one of my friends. We apply the model to find the MVP, with success, and to find the find which teams will win the semifinals and the final( 1/2 success)!
We used NumPy and Pandas frameworks to calculate the results using all the stats of the players and the teams. The formulas, calculations, and results are in the .ipynb files. The .csv files represent the stats about the entire league.
If you want to predict the MVP and the winning team for the current season, all you have to do is to change the old statistics with the actuals.
Ppt presentation is in the Romanian language!
